# PIC16F84-Simulation
Simulating the PIC 16F84 Mikrocontroller, because our University made us to
The Idea is to basically completley simulate the internal Structure of a microcontroller,
eventhough it's no t necessary and will requiere an accurate mapping of all elements.
The benefits of such approach is extendability and ease of programming such thing in tandem.
